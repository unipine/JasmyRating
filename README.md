### General info: <br />

<br />
Users can make a profile, find another profiles, and review other profiles. <br />
Each profile contains a description of the profile (type of services that the profile is offering). <br />
Find profiles by searching their public key. Then its possible to read all the reviews that other users left, or review the profile. <br />
<br />
 
Main 2 files in this project are `Reviews.sol` and `App.js`:   <br />
- `Reviews.sol`: The smart contract, written in Solidity, contains all the logic of the app. <br />
- `App.js`: The front end. using react, html, and web3, connects the smart contract with the app. <br />


Actions that require generating a new block in the blockcahin (like editing profile or leaving a review) will require a payment using the MetaMask wallet.
